## Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations

This program takes two numbers from the user and performs the following basic mathematical operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division


## Task 2: Create a Personalized Greeting

This program takes the user's first name and last name as input, concatenates them into a full name, and then displays a personalized greeting message.

### Example Output: "Hello, John Doe! Welcome to the Python Program"

ASSIGNMENT 2: Control Structures in Python

---
## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

This program takes an integer from the user and checks whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.


## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop

This program uses a for loop to iterate over numbers from 1 to 50 and displays the sum of all.

ASSIGNMENT 3: Functions & Modules in Python

---
## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

This program takes an integer from the user and returns the calculated factorial using a loop or recursion.

### How it works: 

The factorial function is called recursively until the number reached 1.
Like:
f = 1
n = 3
f = n * (n-1)! till n reaches 1.


## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

This program takes an integer from the user and uses the math module to calculate and display the square, natural log, sine of that number.

ASSIGNMENT 4: Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

---
## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors

This program opens and read text file and prints its contents. Also it handles errors if file does not exist.


## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File

This program takes user input and writes it to a file, then takes additional user input and append to same file.

ASSIGNMENT 5: Data Structures and Strings in Python

---
## Task 1: Create a Dictionary of Student Marks

This program takes the student name as input and returns the student's mark from pre-existing dictionary.Also if the student's name not found, print appropriate not-found message.


## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing 

This program extracts and prints the first five elements from the list of numbers from 1 to 10 and also prints the reverse of extracted elements.
